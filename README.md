# Website-Blocker

This is something I made for myself back when I was just starting to getting on with my computer path in life and at times even today I use this if I have to concenterate or work without any deviations in my work. I wanted to built something for myself which will help me save my time and stay focused on better things.

This chunk of code is not more than 30 lines and it saved my day many times. 
"WEBSITE BLOCKER" is a peice of code that I wrote to stop some sites to work during the specified time and automatically after the time limit these sites are accesible.
What it does is it just adds few sites that you want to block and prohibit access to for the time limit you want, and after that time these sites are automatically removed from the list and you can access them afte the time limit passed. And the best part is, this chunk of code runs in background as a windows process, on startup it automatically triggers.
Thats it!!
But as it sounds so easy, doing it took a special trick, if you go through the code you can see a neat trick that is pulled here.

It is helpful and useful in ways that can multiply your work hours. And also in cases if you want to block certain sites to accessible by anyone.



AND IF YOU WANT TO ADD THIS TO YOUR WINDOWS PROCESS, YOU NEED TO DO SOME STEPS WHICH I'LL BE EXPLAINING DOWN BELOW.

HOW TO RUN IT ON YOUR OWN COMPUTER

Step 1 : Fork and Clown this repo. , download the code to your machine and change the paths, you'll get an idea about what path you must replace when you see the codee.
